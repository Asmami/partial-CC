# partial-CC
Partial Cross-Correlation optimizes CC for use on a large number of images. Works best with images that have an evenly distrubuted frequency spectrum.
This repository contains HDL code of my partial cross-correlation  and a python implentation. The HDL code has some instances of an Xilinx FFT IP. 
For understanding and implementation one should read my master's Thesis. I do not have the time to write documentation right now.
