# partial-CC
Partial Cross-Correlation optimizes CC for use on a large number of images. Works best with images that have an evenly distrubuted frequency spectrum.
This repository contains HDL code of my partial cross-correlation  and a python implentation. The HDL code has some instances of an Xilinx FFT IP.
